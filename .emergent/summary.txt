The AI engineer successfully progressed Xionimus AI through several development phases. Initially, it established a robust multi-agent backend and a rich React/FastAPI frontend, focusing on agent interaction and research history. Phase 5, PDF Export and Cloud Sync for research history, was partially implemented, involving new backend models, PDF generation, MongoDB integration, and corresponding frontend updates. Extensive debugging followed, covering , / compatibility, backend API path issues, and  manager errors, achieving 100% backend test pass. Frontend debugging addressed  issues,  conflicts, and critical UI interaction failures, primarily due to  misconfigurations and incorrect dropdown positioning. Later, the AI focused on cleanup (API key removal, documentation creation) and rigorous Windows compatibility fixes for various Python modules. The most recent and ongoing task is resolving persistent frontend button unresponsiveness, which is still being debugged based on user feedback and a provided screenshot.

The Xionimus AI project aims to deliver a web-based, cloud-native platform, evolving from a local agent, featuring a Cloud Backend, Web Client, Session Engine, Cloud Sandbox, Collaboration Layer, and robust API Integration. Key requirements included a visually striking glossy Black Golden Web interface with strong mobile responsiveness and animations. The core development focused on an Agenten Phase, integrating specialized AI agents (Research, Code Review, Debugging, Testing, Documentation, Security, Performance, Fork), with particular emphasis on a Research Agent utilizing Perplexity Sonar Deep Research. The UI needed specific enhancements like a side-dropdown agent selector, autonomous agent routing, a detailed Research Results Panel with download, export, and filtering capabilities, and a Research History Panel with auto-save functionality. Recent work included implementing Phase 5 (PDF Export & Cloud Sync for research history), comprehensive debugging, cleanup, and enhancing Windows compatibility.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in deep debugging of critical frontend UI interaction issues. Specifically, many buttons, including the Send button and Logout button, were unclickable. This problem was traced back to  CSS properties, where parent containers had , inadvertently blocking clicks on child interactive elements. The AI has made multiple attempts to systematically apply  only to non-interactive containers and  to all interactive children in . Despite these iterative fixes and multiple frontend rebuilds and restarts, the user reported that Die buttons gehen nicht (The buttons don't work) again, and provided a screenshot, indicating the issue is still unresolved and requires further investigation. The current state is that the  configuration is believed to be fixed, but user testing proves otherwise, indicating a deeper or more nuanced CSS interaction issue is at play.
