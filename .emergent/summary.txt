The trajectory outlines an iterative debugging process for the Xionimus AI application. Initially, the core problem involved transitioning from an  package to direct Anthropic/Perplexity API calls, which necessitated refactoring backend code and dependency management. Recurring issues included misconfigured  in the frontend, preventing API key saving, and Windows-specific environment challenges (paths, PowerShell syntax, Unicode errors in  files). The AI engineer continuously created and refined Windows batch scripts for local installation and startup. Throughout, invalid LLM model names for both Claude and Perplexity caused API  errors, requiring multiple corrections. The user's API key configuration remained an outstanding dependency. The final problem identified is a persistent incorrect Claude model in , despite prior attempts to fix it, immediately before the summary request.

<product_requirements>
The Xionimus AI is a web-based AI assistant with chat, code, and project management features, designed as an advanced AI platform. It requires multi-agent support and integrates Perplexity and Claude, now updated to Claude Opus 4. The UI was redesigned from dystopian cyberpunk to a modern dark purple/blue gradient theme. The agent system routes tasks to specialized agents (Code, Research, Writing, Data, QA, GitHub, File, Session). New features include GitHub integration, file upload, session fork functionality, voice input, and an API key settings button. All data is stored locally using MongoDB and the file system, aiming for infinite context via smart context loading. The goal is a stable, locally persistent application with direct API integrations.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively debugging persistent issues with the AI chat functionality, specifically that no messages were going out and that no AI was working.

The latest critical issue identified by the AI engineer is that the Claude API calls were failing with a  error because the model specified in  at line 285 was still , which is an invalid model name, despite previous attempts to correct it across various agent files and the main server.py. The AI has already identified this as the root cause of the current Claude API failure.

Prior to this, a recurring problem was the  file reverting to an external Emergent URL instead of , which was fixed. The AI also addressed issues with  and  to ensure they run correctly on Windows, preventing immediate window closures. The Perplexity model () was updated and now  is being used. The system's health check () currently indicates that both Perplexity and Claude API keys are , meaning the user still needs to input them into the frontend settings.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Correct the Claude model name in  at line 285 to a valid model (), then re-instruct the user to configure their API keys via the frontend settings.
