# Tiktoken Installation Fix for Windows

## Problem
Tiktoken was missing from `requirements-windows.txt`, causing the warning:
```
⚠️ Tiktoken not installed. Using approximate counting (4 chars = 1 token).
```

## What Was Fixed
✅ Added `tiktoken>=0.8.0` to `/app/backend/requirements-windows.txt`

## How to Fix on Your Windows Machine

### Option 1: Reinstall Dependencies (Recommended)
```bash
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install tiktoken
```

### Option 2: Full Reinstall
```bash
# Run the install.bat script again
install.bat
```

### Option 3: Manual Installation
```bash
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install tiktoken>=0.8.0
```

## Verification
After installation, restart your backend and verify:

```bash
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
python -c "import tiktoken; print('✅ Tiktoken installed:', tiktoken.__version__)"
```

You should see:
```
✅ Tiktoken installed: 0.8.0
```

## Additional Info
- The auto_setup.py already tries to install tiktoken on startup
- However, install.bat uses requirements-windows.txt which was missing it
- This has now been fixed for future installations
- Existing installations need to manually install tiktoken once

## Files Updated
- ✅ `/app/backend/requirements-windows.txt` - Added tiktoken>=0.8.0
- ✅ `/app/backend/requirements.txt` - Already had tiktoken==0.8.0
- ✅ `/app/backend/requirements-windows-VERIFIED.txt` - Already had tiktoken==0.8.0
- ✅ `/app/backend/app/core/auto_setup.py` - Already auto-installs tiktoken

## Benefits of Tiktoken
With tiktoken installed, you get:
- **Precise token counting** instead of approximation
- **Better cost estimation** for AI API calls
- **Accurate context limit tracking** for session management
- **Model-specific tokenization** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude)

Example improvement:
- Old estimation: 16 tokens (65 chars / 4)
- Tiktoken: 13 tokens (accurate)
