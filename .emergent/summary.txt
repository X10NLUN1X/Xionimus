The previous AI engineer successfully executed a complex sequence of development, quality assurance, and refactoring tasks, transitioning the application from a heavily buggy state to a stable, feature-rich platform now named Xionimus AI. Key accomplishments include resolving critical infrastructure issues (port/environment variable mismatches, CORS), implementing crucial frontend features (Monaco Editor UX, File Upload UI, Theme Toggle), and introducing intelligent agent assignment logic in the backend. Crucially, the engineer managed a complete reversal in the AI architectureâ€”first integrating  and then fully decoupling, reverting to a robust classic API key implementation using the latest LLM models (GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1). The entire project was then subjected to a comprehensive rebranding from Emergent-next to Xionimus AI, affecting directory names, configuration, and all source code references, concluding with a successful security and functionality audit.

The primary objective was transforming the original XIONIMUS AI concept into an Emergent-like development platform, supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity using classic API keys. Core requirements achieved include: a functional Chat/AI-Engine MVP, a comprehensive Development Environment featuring the Monaco Editor, a File Manager with tree view, drag-and-drop chunked file upload/download up to 250MB, and a responsive UI/UX cloned after Emergent.sh, featuring a black/gold aesthetic and a functional Dark/Light mode toggle. The final state demands exclusive use of classic API keys (no Emergent integrations) and the implementation of an intelligent agent system that automatically assigns specific, high-tier LLMs (like GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1) based on the user's task context. Pending requirements include full Authentication/User Management and advanced File Versioning.

**Key File Edits:** All files within  were searched and renamed/updated to reflect the new Xionimus AI brand. Critical fixes include resolving port inconsistencies in  and , adding  and integrating it into , and implementing intelligent agent assignment in  and . All  instances were replaced with timezone-aware methods.

<current_work>
Immediately preceding this summary, the AI engineer completed a massive, high-impact rebranding task: renaming the entire project from Emergent-next to Xionimus AI. This included renaming the root project directory, updating , , all core configuration files, and changing all branding references (logo 'E' to 'X') within frontend components like  (formerly ).

Following the rebranding, the engineer:
1.  Redesigned the entire project documentation ().
2.  Executed a comprehensive security and functionality audit based on explicit user requirements (Chat Message 511), focusing on API key non-persistence and successful provider connections (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity).

The audit confirmed:
- No hardcoded or persisted API keys were found.
- The Backend Health Check shows  and .
- The Frontend loads correctly, displaying the new X logo and Xionimus branding.

The work concluded with the successful generation of the  file. The application is now fully rebranded, decoupled from Emergent, using the latest LLM models via classic APIs, and validated for security and core functionality.
