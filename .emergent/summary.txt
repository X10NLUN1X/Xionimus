<analysis>
The AI engineer systematically addressed a wide range of features and bugs for the Xionimus AI application. Initial efforts focused on UI/UX improvements like enhancing GitHub Import Dialog's contrast, fixing 400 Bad Request errors, and building a comprehensive repository management UI. A critical bug preventing AI agents from recognizing imported repositories was tackled by integrating an active project concept into sessions and backend/frontend components. Privacy was improved by excluding chat history from GitHub Push. Subsequent UI/UX overhauls included button repositioning (repeatedly, due to nuances in Welcome vs. Chat views), merging GitHub Push/Import into a single dropdown, and removing all control buttons from the chat toolbar (only to be re-added later per user request). A persistent issue with the GitHub Import dialog not appearing on the Welcome screen led to discovering and fixing a session expiry/GitHub PAT authorization flow problem. Finally, the AI addressed agent access to imported repositories by correcting the workspace root path and ensuring session models included  fields. The last major challenge involved the AI's inability to execute actions autonomously, leading to the engineer providing a detailed analysis of conversational vs. autonomous AI architectures and recommending a hybrid approach, which is the current state.

<product_requirements>
The Xionimus AI application is an intelligent coding assistant offering chat, research, and code generation with reliable streaming, persistent sessions, and API key management. Key features include a Hybrid Multi-Agent Orchestrator for dynamic LLM selection, robust GitHub integration for PAT-based push (with file preview/selection) and import (public/private repos, auto-selection, conflict handling), and cost optimization through intelligent LLM routing. UX enhancements were requested, including an activity panel, real-time activity display, accurate token usage, centered branding, and functional session management (fork option). Recent requirements added a visual repository management UI with delete functionality, ensuring AI agents recognize imported projects, and a file import feature. The UI is transitioning to a Dark Mode-only theme, with action buttons repositioned below the chat input and the Branch button removed. The user also explicitly requested removing demo login information, ensuring the GitHub Import dialog opens in the Welcome screen, and that AI agents can access and act on imported repositories for debugging and other functions without interruption.

**File Edits & Importance:**
-   : **Modified** to correct the  from  to , ensuring repositories are imported to the correct path for AI access. Also updated other path references.
-   : **Modified** to include  and  fields in the  Pydantic model and in session creation/retrieval logic, making this context available to the frontend.
-   : **Modified** to accept  when streaming responses, allowing AI to be aware of the active project.
-   : **Modified** to refine the system prompt, initially to clarify AI's tool usage (then reversed) and later to instruct the AI for auto-continue in a conversational manner to avoid workflow interruptions.
-   : **Extensively Modified** for UI/UX changes:
    -   Repositioned secondary action buttons from the header to below the chat input, handling two distinct rendering paths for the Welcome Screen and Chat View.
    -   Merged GitHub Push and Import into a single dropdown button.
    -   Temporarily removed then re-added all control buttons below the chat bar per user requests, ensuring visibility in both Welcome and Chat views.
    -   Integrated  into the Welcome Screen's render block.
-   : **Modified** to remove demo login information.
-   : **Modified** to remove demo login information.
-   : **Fixed** a typo ( to ).
-   : **Modified** to handle repository loading errors gracefully without logging out the user immediately, and to ensure  is passed as a string ID.
-   : **Modified** to ensure  is included in WebSocket requests and to manage 401 Unauthorized errors more selectively, preventing auto-logout when specific dialogs like GitHub Import are attempting to load (e.g., when no GitHub PAT is configured).

<pending_tasks>
-   **Multi-Agent Streaming & Activity Panel Display**: The multi-agent system output is not streamed, and real-time activities are not fully displayed in the activity panel.
-   **Fork Agent debugging/completion**: Debugging or refinement may be needed for Auto-Warnung bei hoher Context-Auslastung + manueller Fork-Button.
-   **Autonomous AI implementation**: The strategic shift to a Partial Autonomous system (read-only tools automated, write tools with confirmation) is a mid-term recommendation, not yet implemented.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a strategic discussion with the user regarding the application's AI architecture. The user explicitly asked for the Pros and Cons of switching to autonomous AI.

The engineer provided a comprehensive analysis, contrasting the current conversational architecture with a potential autonomous one. This analysis covered:
-   **Pros of Autonomous**: True automation (direct tool calls), better code quality, enhanced developer experience (like GitHub Copilot Workspace), improved error handling, and competitive advantage.
-   **Cons of Autonomous**: Significant security risks (uncontrolled code execution, requiring robust sandboxing), increased API call/token costs, higher architectural complexity (multi-provider function calling, state management, error handling), increased latency due to sequential tool calls, debugging difficulty, unpredictability, and a major refactoring effort for the existing Xionimus architecture.
-   The analysis included practical scenarios (debugging, creating a login page) to illustrate the benefits of an autonomous approach.
-   It concluded with a strategic recommendation for Xionimus:
    -   **Short-term:** Optimize current conversational AI and improve system prompts (which the engineer attempted with auto-continue prompt changes).
    -   **Mid-term:** Implement a Partial Autonomous system (read-only tools automated, write operations with user confirmation), integrate OpenAI Function Calling for tools, and establish a sandbox environment.
    -   **Long-term:** Explore a fully autonomous system as a premium feature.

The engineer has just finished presenting this analysis and explicitly asked the user: Möchten Sie, dass ich mit der Implementierung eines Partial Autonomous Systems beginne? Das wäre der beste nächste Schritt! (Would you like me to start with the implementation of a Partial Autonomous System? That would be the best next step!).
