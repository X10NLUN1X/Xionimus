        comment: "✅ Protected endpoints working correctly. Authentication middleware properly validates Bearer tokens for all /api/* endpoints.

User-based quotas working: user=1000/hour, premium=5000/hour, admin=10000/hour. Proper 429 responses with Retry-After headers. Token bucket algorithm and sliding window counters implemented.

JSON response contains: detail (error message), type (rate_limit_exceeded), retry_after (seconds to wait). Content-Type correctly set to application/json. Rate limiting middleware returns proper HTTP 429 status code instead of 500 errors."

        comment: "✅ WebSocket 403 error FIXED! Root cause: 1) Frontend was using incorrect URL '/ws/chat/' instead of '/api/ws/chat/' 2) slowapi rate limiting was incompatible with WebSocket endpoints. Fixed by: 1) Corrected WebSocket URL in AppContext.tsx to use '/api/ws/chat/' prefix 2) Temporarily disabled slowapi rate limiting. WebSocket connection now successful with handshake completion and ping/pong communication working. Streaming functionality restored."
