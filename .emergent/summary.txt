The previous AI engineer effectively transformed the Xionimus AI application through iterative development. Initially, they focused on fixing database session persistence, identifying and correcting a SQLAlchemy session issue in background tasks. Concurrently, they verified the existing fork functionality and multi-agent system, noting the latter was disabled. A significant portion involved shifting GitHub integration from OAuth to Personal Access Tokens (PAT) based on user preference, which required schema updates and frontend UI refactoring. Extensive work was done on AI model cost optimization, introducing cheaper LLMs and implementing a Hybrid Model Router for intelligent model selection, first generally, then specifically for research tasks, resulting in substantial cost savings. The UI was also improved by centering the Xionimus AI logo and enabling real-time code streaming with syntax highlighting. The engineer also debugged frontend authentication for PAT and optimized model usage for small talk. The last completed task was removing the old GitHub push functionality, prompting the current task to re-implement independent GitHub push.

The core problem Xionimus AI aims to solve is providing an intelligent coding assistant with robust chat, research, and code generation capabilities. The user’s requests have evolved this from a basic MVP:
1.  **Core Functionality:** Ensure reliable chat streaming, session persistence, and API key management via UI.
2.  **AI Workflow Refinement:** Remove unwanted Auto Code Review and Expansion Agent messages. Enable dynamic research options (Klein/Mittel/Groß/Auto) that automatically lead to coding without further prompts. Allow AI to continue coding and expanding on existing code.
3.  **User Experience:** Display activity panel consistently in split-screen, show real-time research/coding activities including thought streaming and source counts. Resolve duplicate chat messages. Center Xionimus AI branding.
4.  **Architectural Evolution:** Implement a Hybrid Multi-Agent Orchestrator using specialized AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity) for different tasks (e.g., ARCHITECT, ENGINEER). Enable streaming multi-agent output.
5.  **GitHub Integration:** Initially requested a fix for GitHub connection, which evolved from OAuth to Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication for direct repository interaction. The app should be able to push to GitHub independently, not rely on Emergent.sh's platform features.
6.  **Cost Optimization:** Analyze and integrate cheaper LLM models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku) and implement a Hybrid System with smart routing to balance cost and quality, particularly for general conversations and research tasks.
7.  **Session Management:** Ensure chat sessions are persistently saved and automatically loaded upon reload. Investigate and implement a fork option for sessions.

<code_architecture>

-   : Central chat logic. Modified to remove old review logic, integrate multi-agent orchestrator, save messages more robustly, and utilize hybrid model routing.
-   : Implements hybrid multi-agent system, currently disabled by default. Defines agents and model assignments.
-   : Logic for detecting coding prompts and research. Modified to include hybrid model routing for research.
-   : Main chat UI. Heavily modified to display activity panel, research options, real-time code streaming, and center the logo.
-   : Displays agent activities. Modified for always-visible display and enhanced info.
-   : Global state. Updated for message deduplication and persistent loading of the last active session.
-   : Entry point. Updated to remove deprecated router entries and include new  router.
-   : Environment variables. Verified, noted missing GitHub OAuth credentials earlier.
-   : Database initialization. Addressed for session persistence.
-   : SQLAlchemy models. Examined for session schema.
-   : Updated to include  and  fields for PAT authentication.
-   : **NEW FILE.** Contains API endpoints for saving and managing GitHub Personal Access Tokens.
-   : **NEW FILE.** Implements intelligent model selection based on task complexity for cost/quality optimization, including specific logic for research.
-   : UI for settings. Refactored to replace old GitHub OAuth with PAT-based configuration and removed in-app GitHub push functionality.
-   : **NEW FILE.** Renders code snippets with syntax highlighting during real-time streaming.
-   : Existing component for static code rendering. Verified for use with .
-   , : Updated to correctly use  for consistent code rendering.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Multi-Agent Streaming & Activity Panel Display:** The multi-agent system is implemented but its output is not streamed, and agents' real-time activities are not fully displayed in the activity panel. The multi-agent mode is currently disabled by default.
-   **GitHub Push Functionality:** The user explicitly requested to implement direct GitHub push from Xionimus AI itself, replacing the previous redirection to Emergent.sh's Save to GitHub feature.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the previous AI engineer was addressing the user's concern that the GitHub push functionality within Xionimus AI was still using the old OAuth system and, furthermore, was redirecting to Emergent.sh's Save to GitHub feature, which the user did not want.

The user's explicit request was: 4. Werden zu Emergent.sh Save to GitHub geleitet das möchte ich nicht. er soll selber zu github pushen. Entkoppel alle verbindungen die aktiv zu emergent.sh gehen (4. Redirected to Emergent.sh 'Save to GitHub' which I don't want. It should push to GitHub itself. Disconnect all active connections that go to emergent.sh).

The AI engineer's most recent action in response to this was to remove the  function and its associated UI elements from . This action was intended to eliminate the old OAuth-based push, but it implicitly removed the in-app push functionality entirely, directing the user to the platform's Save to GitHub feature. The user's latest message clearly indicates this is not the desired outcome; they want Xionimus AI to perform its *own* GitHub push using the already implemented PAT system.

<optional_next_step>
Re-implement GitHub push functionality within Xionimus AI, utilizing the existing PAT system.
