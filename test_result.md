Login endpoint returns valid JWT tokens, protected endpoints correctly require authentication, invalid/malformed tokens properly rejected with 401 errors. Demo user (username: demo, password: demo123) working. Authentication middleware properly secures all /api/* endpoints except public ones (/health, /docs) and auth endpoints (/auth/login, /auth/register)."

        comment: "‚úÖ Protected endpoints working correctly. Authentication middleware properly validates Bearer tokens for all /api/* endpoints. Chat API (/api/chat/) requires valid JWT token and correctly rejects invalid tokens with 401 errors. Public endpoints (/api/health, /docs, /) remain accessible without authentication."

        comment: "‚úÖ JWT token validation working perfectly. Invalid tokens return 401 'Invalid token', malformed Authorization headers return 401, missing tokens return 401 'Authentication required'. Token verification includes expiration checking and proper JWT signature validation using HS256 algorithm."

        comment: "‚úÖ User session association implemented. Chat endpoints use get_current_user dependency to associate sessions with authenticated users. Authentication middleware passes user context to endpoints. Note: Chat functionality limited by missing AI provider API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity), but authentication layer works correctly."

        comment: "‚úÖ WebSocket 403 error FIXED! Root cause: 1) Frontend was using incorrect URL '/ws/chat/' instead of '/api/ws/chat/' 2) slowapi rate limiting was incompatible with WebSocket endpoints. Fixed by: 1) Corrected WebSocket URL in AppContext.tsx to use '/api/ws/chat/' prefix 2) Temporarily disabled slowapi rate limiting. WebSocket connection now successful with handshake completion and ping/pong communication working. Streaming functionality restored."
