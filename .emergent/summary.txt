The AI engineer completed an initial comprehensive hardening of the Xionimus AI project, fulfilling 13 prioritized tasks covering dependency management, security, test coverage, database optimization, API versioning, operational resilience, frontend optimization, accessibility, and monitoring. Post-completion, critical issues with  and  were systematically debugged and resolved by adjusting middleware and explicitly registering endpoints in .

Subsequently, the user requested an autonomous system like GitHub Copilot, initially leading to the development of a local Windows agent. This involved creating new backend WebSocket and settings APIs, agent database models, and a frontend UI for status and configuration. Significant debugging was required for database imports, SQLAlchemy model definitions, and asynchronous execution within the agent's file watcher. This Phase 1 was thoroughly tested, verified, and declared production-ready.

However, a major product pivot occurred. The user decided to transform Xionimus into a **fully web-based, cloud-native platform**, abandoning the local agent concept. A new roadmap was defined, focusing on a cloud backend, session engine, cloud sandbox, and real-time collaboration. The AI engineer is currently assessing the existing codebase against this new, radically different strategic direction.

The user initially requested a comprehensive hardening of the Xionimus AI project. This included: dependency management, security (secrets, CORS), expanded test coverage, SQLite database optimization (indexing), API versioning, operational resiliency (backup, deployment), frontend optimization (code-splitting, lazy loading, minification), accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard navigation), and an advanced monitoring system (Prometheus, Grafana). All initial tasks were implemented, and critical backend routing/authentication issues for  and  were resolved.

Following this, the user requested an autonomous system akin to GitHub Copilot or emergent.sh, emphasizing reduced user input and a Windows-only, web-based frontend with status display and API key input. The AI engineer implemented this as a local Windows agent (Phase 1), incorporating real-time file monitoring, WebSocket communication, Claude AI (Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.1) for analysis, dedicated backend APIs and database models, and a frontend dashboard.

A significant pivot then occurred: the user mandated transforming Xionimus into a **fully web-based, cloud-native platform**, similar to emergent.sh. The new roadmap eliminates local installations, focusing on a cloud backend (REST+WebSocket API, cloud DB, auth), a web client (browser UI with chat, code, logs), a session engine (AI context, history, persistence), a cloud sandbox for secure code execution, a chat + code interface, browser-based project management, a plugin/API integration system, a real-time collaboration layer, and a responsive UI.

The project is a full-stack application within a  monorepo, utilizing a React frontend and FastAPI backend. It currently uses SQLite and ChromaDB.



**Wichtige Dateien und Ã„nderungen:**
*   : The core FastAPI entry point. It was modified to correctly handle  and  authentication bypass during the hardening phase. More recently, it was updated to  for the new  and  APIs, and to add the agent WebSocket path to .
*   : A newly created backend WebSocket endpoint to facilitate real-time communication between the backend and the (now conceptually deprecated) local autonomous agent.
*   : A new backend API endpoint to manage configuration settings for the autonomous agent. Required fixes for  import and .
*   : New SQLAlchemy database models for  and , used to track agent status and events. Required crucial fixes for correctly inheriting from the shared  and renaming a reserved  attribute.
*   : Modified to import  to ensure their tables are initialized.
*   : A new directory created for the local Windows autonomous agent. Key files include  (responsible for monitoring file changes, fixed for ) and  (the agent's main script, also fixed for async operations). This entire local agent structure is now functionally deprecated by the new web-based roadmap.
*   : The main React application entry, modified to register the new  route, leading to the .
*   : A new React component to visually indicate the connection status of the autonomous agent in the frontend UI.
*   : A new React page for configuring agent settings, including input fields for API keys and watched directories. It required a fix to correctly use  for environment variables.
*   : Modified to integrate and display the  in its header, along with logic to fetch and display agent status.
*    and : New scripts for local Windows agent installation (functionality now superseded).
*   : Significantly rewritten to outline a new vision for a fully web-based, cloud-native platform, deprecating the local agent concept.
*   : A newly created document intended to analyze the current codebase against the new web-based roadmap.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had successfully implemented and thoroughly tested Phase 1 of the autonomous system, which comprised a local Windows agent, its backend integration via WebSockets and REST APIs, database persistence for agent activities, Claude AI for code analysis, and a frontend UI for status display and settings. This local agent system was verified to be production-ready.

However, the user then initiated a complete product pivot, shifting the vision from a local agent to a **fully web-based, cloud-native platform**, analogous to emergent.sh. This new roadmap entirely discards the local agent concept and introduces new phases for cloud backend, web client, session engine, cloud sandbox, collaboration, and plugin systems. The AI engineer's most recent action was to revise the  document to reflect this new strategic direction and to initiate an analysis of the existing Xionimus codebase to identify what components are still relevant for the new web-based roadmap, documented in .
