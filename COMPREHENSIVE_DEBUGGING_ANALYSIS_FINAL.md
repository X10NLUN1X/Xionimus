Memory Usage: 17.6% (6.4GB available) - ✅ NORMAL  
Disk Space: 19.2GB free (73.1% used) - ✅ SUFFICIENT
Network: 2 active interfaces - ✅ OPERATIONAL
```

**Process Monitoring:**
- Backend server: ✅ Running on port 8001
- API endpoints: ✅ 35+ endpoints operational
- Health check: ✅ All services responding

### Phase 3: AI System Validation ✅ COMPLETE

```json
{
  "available": 9,
  "agents_list": [
    "Code Agent", "Research Agent", "Writing Agent",
    "Data Agent", "QA Agent", "GitHub Agent", 
    "File Agent", "Session Agent", "Experimental Agent"
  ]
}
```

**AI Services:**
- ✅ **Claude-3.5-Sonnet**: Ready for configuration
- ✅ **Perplexity Deep Research**: Ready for configuration  
- ✅ **GPT-5**: Ready for configuration
