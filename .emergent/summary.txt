The trajectory documents an extensive debugging and refactoring effort on the Xionimus AI application. The work began with implementing user-requested features: a Fork Summary and Push to GitHub functionality, which involved creating new backend endpoints and updating the frontend settings page. A subsequent user request shifted development towards a UI-based configuration for GitHub OAuth credentials, moving away from environment variables and introducing a new settings API and local JSON file for persistence.

This feature work quickly pivoted to critical bug fixing when the user reported that the chat functionality was broken. The root cause was a major architectural inconsistency: the application's database had been migrated to SQLite/SQLAlchemy, but key API modules (, , ) still contained legacy MongoDB query code. This triggered a cascade of issues.

The engineer systematically refactored the  module, encountering and resolving schema mismatches, SQLAlchemy-specific errors (like reserved keywords), and bugs in AI model response streaming. The debugging process also uncovered and fixed frontend issues, including a React Invalid hook call error due to dependency conflicts and a critical stale closure bug in the application's context that caused the UI to disappear after receiving a message.

The final phase, initiated by a user request for a full code audit, involved a systematic cleanup of the entire codebase. The engineer started Phase 1 of this audit, which included setting the , migrating the remaining modules (, ) to SQLAlchemy, and consolidating the database access patterns. The work concluded as the engineer began Phase 2 of the audit, focusing on removing dead code.

The primary objective is to evolve the Xionimus AI application from a feature-rich MVP into a stable, secure, and production-ready desktop tool. Initial user requests focused on adding new GitHub integration features, specifically a Fork Summary and a Push Project capability, accessible from the settings page.

A key pivot in requirements was the user's demand for a UI-based configuration for sensitive credentials (like GitHub OAuth keys and AI API keys) instead of relying on  files, enhancing user-friendliness for a desktop application.

However, the most critical underlying requirement that emerged was to achieve core application stability. A series of user-reported bugs revealed deep architectural flaws, including a partially completed database migration from MongoDB to SQLite. Therefore, the main product goal became ensuring the chat functionality—the application's core feature—is completely functional, reliable, and robust. This involves completing the database migration, fixing all related backend errors, resolving frontend rendering bugs, and ensuring a seamless, error-free user experience. The final requirement is a comprehensive code audit to identify and fix remaining issues, ensuring long-term maintainability and security.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend:** React (Vite), Chakra UI, TypeScript
- **Database:** Full migration from MongoDB legacy code to a unified SQLite backend using the SQLAlchemy ORM.
- **State Management:** React Context, which was the source of a critical stale closure bug.
- **Debugging:** Resolved WebSocket connection errors, API key handling issues, conflicting React dependencies ( in ), and AI response streaming logic for reasoning models.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with separate  and  directories.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Core of the chat functionality. Was the main source of critical bugs.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This file was entirely refactored. All legacy MongoDB queries (, , etc.) were replaced with modern SQLAlchemy ORM queries (, , etc.) to align with the application's SQLite database.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The FastAPI application entrypoint.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** A critical bug was fixed by removing a redundant WebSocket endpoint () that was overriding the correct streaming endpoint defined in . It was also updated to correctly receive and pass API keys sent from the frontend over the WebSocket connection.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Manages the global state for the frontend, including chat messages.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** A critical stale closure bug was fixed. The  calls in both  and  were changed from  to the functional update form . This prevented the chat history from being wiped out after receiving a response.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Handles all interactions with external AI models.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** The streaming logic was fixed to correctly handle  objects from the OpenAI SDK, resolving an  crash. The logic was also reordered to check if a response is a stream *before* attempting to access non-existent attributes.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Manages frontend dependencies.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** An  block was added to enforce a single version of , fixing an Invalid hook call error that was crashing the application.

<pending_tasks>
- **Complete Phase 2 of the Code Audit:** The engineer was in the middle of executing the High Priority tasks from the .
- **Implement Fork Summary Feature:** The UI and backend endpoint exist but the business logic to generate a meaningful summary needs to be fully implemented.
- **Implement Push to GitHub Feature:** The UI and backend endpoint exist, but the logic to commit and push the project files is not implemented.

<current_work>
The engineer is actively executing a comprehensive, multi-phase code audit requested by the user to stabilize the entire application. The immediate work is focused on systematically resolving issues identified in the .

**Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Completed):**
The engineer just finished the first and most critical phase of the audit. This involved:
1.  **Security:** Creating a  file in the backend and populating it with a securely generated  to resolve a critical startup warning.
2.  **Database Migration:** Completing the migration from legacy MongoDB code to SQLAlchemy for the  and  API endpoints. This was a crucial step to eliminate the root cause of many bugs.
3.  **Code Consolidation:** Unifying the database strategy by refactoring all code to use the SQLAlchemy ORM () and deprecating the old, conflicting raw SQLite manager ().
4.  **Code Cleanup:** Removing duplicated and unused code related to the rate limiter.

After applying these fixes, the backend was successfully restarted.

**Phase 2: High Priority (In Progress):**
Upon user confirmation, the engineer began Phase 2. The very last actions taken were part of task , which involved removing an old frontend file () and identifying and deprecating several unused modules in the backend core directory.

<optional_next_step>
Continue with Phase 2 of the code audit by implementing the next task: **2.2 - Error Handling Patterns verbessern**, which involves replacing generic  blocks with more specific exceptions in .
