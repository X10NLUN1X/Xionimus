The AI engineer successfully progressed Xionimus AI through several development phases, focusing on enhancing its web-based agent capabilities. Phase 1 involved setting up and comprehensively testing external API integrations for Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and GitHub, meticulously using user-provided API keys and adjusting timeouts for long-running processes like Perplexity Deep Research. Phase 2 established the backend architecture for various agents (Research, Code Review, Debugging, Testing, Documentation, Security, Performance, Fork), creating their core classes and an orchestrator. Phase 3 encompassed both backend API development for agent interaction and a significant frontend overhaul. On the backend, multi-agent endpoints were added, and an authentication system was integrated. On the frontend, new UI components for agent selection and result display were built into the . Autonomous agent routing was implemented, mirroring Emergent's system, and the Research Results Panel was enhanced with download, export, and filtering. Phase 4 introduced research history functionality, allowing automatic saving and retrieval of agent outputs within a dedicated UI panel. The trajectory concludes with the user requesting to start Phase 5, which involves PDF Export & Cloud Sync.

The Xionimus AI project aims to create a web-based, cloud-native platform, transitioning from a local agent, with key components including a Cloud Backend, Web Client, Session Engine, Cloud Sandbox, Collaboration Layer, Plugin/API Integration, and Deployment/Scaling. The initial focus was the Web Client UI, transforming it from Chakra UI to a custom glossy Black Golden Web interface with strong mobile responsiveness and animations. The problem addressed in this trajectory was the comprehensive implementation of an Agenten Phase. This includes integrating multiple test agents and sub-agents (Research, Code Review, Debugging, Testing, Documentation, Security, Performance, Fork), with a specific emphasis on a Research Agent utilizing Perplexity Sonar Deep Research. The UI for these agents, particularly the Research Agent, was required to reflect specific user-provided visual designs, including a side-dropdown selector, autonomous agent routing, enhanced result display with download/export/filtering, and a research history panel with auto-save. The ultimate goal is to provide an interactive, intuitive, and professional user experience for agent-driven development.

<code_architecture>
The project maintains a monorepo structure with  containing both  (React/TypeScript) and  (FastAPI/Python) directories.



*   ** (New)**: Defines Pydantic models for agent-related data structures used in the backend.
*   ** (New)**: Provides a base class for all agents, encapsulating common functionalities and interface definitions.
*   ** (New)**: Individual files (e.g., , ) implementing the logic for each specific agent, inheriting from .
*   ** (New)**: Manages the lifecycle and routing of different agents based on user requests or autonomous decisions.
*   ** (New)**: Centralized configuration for API-related settings, including timeouts for external services like Perplexity.
*   ** (New)**: Defines FastAPI routes for interacting with the multi-agent system, supporting operations like agent execution and status checks.
*   ** (Modified)**: Integrates the  router, making the new agent API endpoints accessible.
*   ** (Modified)**: Updated to include new Python dependencies like  for server-sent events.
*   ** (New)**: Handles communication between the frontend and the backend's multi-agent API.
*   ** (New)**: UI component for selecting active agents or displaying the autonomous agent status.
*   ** (New, Modified)**: Displays detailed results from the Research Agent, now including enhanced source visualization, download, export, and category filtering.
*   ** (New)**: A generic component to display results from any agent, supporting different output formats.
*   ** (New)**: Displays a history of research queries and their results, allowing users to revisit past agent interactions.
*   ** (Modified extensively)**: The core chat interface, modified to integrate , , and . It now manages agent selection state, handles agent execution logic, and displays agent-specific outputs alongside regular chat messages.
*   ** (New)**: Contains logic for autonomously determining which agent to use based on user input, mirroring Emergent's system.
*   ** (New)**: Utility functions for managing and storing research history in the frontend, enabling auto-save functionality.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed Phase 4 of the project. This phase focused on implementing **Research History** functionality within the frontend. A new utility file, , was created to manage the saving and retrieval of research results. A dedicated UI component, , was developed to display this history. These new components were then integrated into the main chat interface, . The  was modified to automatically save research results to the history whenever an agent is executed. Furthermore, a button was added to the UI to toggle the visibility of the , which is presented as a drawer or modal. The frontend was successfully rebuilt and restarted to apply these changes, and a comprehensive summary confirmed the auto-save functionality is working. The very last message in the trajectory is the user's explicit instruction: Start phase 5.
