TECHNICAL ANALYSIS: The GitHub import endpoint code (lines 609-614) is designed to work without authentication for public repos ('optional for public repos', 'attempting public repo clone'), but the authentication middleware in main.py (lines 147-162) does not include '/api/github/import' in the public_paths list, causing 401 'Authentication required' errors for unauthenticated requests.

ROOT CAUSE: The GitHub import endpoint code is designed to work without authentication for public repos (lines 609-614: 'optional for public repos', 'attempting public repo clone'), but authentication middleware in main.py does not include '/api/github/import' in public_paths list (lines 147-162), causing 401 'Authentication required' errors.

        comment: "⚠️ CORS configuration partially working. cors_config.py exists and is properly structured. CORS preflight (OPTIONS) requests work correctly (200 response). However, no CORS headers found in actual GET responses, suggesting CORS middleware may not be properly applied to all endpoints."

AUTHENTICATION MIDDLEWARE FIX CONFIRMED: Public endpoints correctly added to public_paths list in main.py (lines 160-184), allowing access without Bearer tokens.

EXECUTION CONFIRMED: Tests located at /app/backend/tests/ and executed with proper PYTHONPATH. Authentication middleware fixes have resolved previous test failures.
