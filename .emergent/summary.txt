The previous AI engineer's work pivoted from debugging an old XIONIMUS AI system to a complete rewrite, Emergent-like, using FastAPI and React/Chakra UI. The initial phase focused on building the Chat/AI-Engine MVP, addressing numerous environment issues (port conflicts, Yarn/NPM discrepancies) and frontend rendering problems (incorrect backend URLs, missing icons). Key features like a Monaco Editor-based development environment with file tree and file upload/download, along with basic file versioning, were implemented and integrated into the frontend. A black and gold design theme was also successfully applied. Critical bugs related to MongoDB boolean checks and dynamic AI model selection were identified and fixed. The latest development involved a complete UI/UX overhaul to clone the Emergent.sh design, which was successfully implemented and validated via screenshots. The current task is to perform a comprehensive code audit as per the user's detailed request.

Initially, the user sought to stabilize an existing XIONIMUS AI multi-agent system, focusing on local startup, installation, and backend connectivity. This evolved into a full rewrite, aiming for an Emergent-like development platform.
The new system's requirements include:
- Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity using direct API keys (no Emergent LLM key).
- A flexible backend for API key and provider selection.
- A modular React/Chakra UI frontend.
- Core functionalities: 1. Chat/AI-Engine MVP (basic API communication, AI chat, Markdown, prompt management, history). 2. Development Environment (Monaco Editor, File Manager with Treeview, upload/download, versioning). 3. Authentication/User Management.
- Local-only installation (, ).
Specific feature preferences from the user included local file storage, Monaco Editor, a 250MB file size limit with chunked upload, and simple file versioning. Later, a black and gold color scheme and a complete design clone of Emergent.sh (left sidebar, main chat, dark/light toggle, responsive) were requested.

<code_architecture>
The application architecture is a clean, modular setup within the  directory, distinctly separate from the old  backup.



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   ****: Modified to accept API keys from the frontend for dynamic AI provider configuration and fixed a critical database boolean check ( to ).
-   ****: Enhanced to handle dynamic API keys passed per request, rather than solely relying on environment variables.
-   ****: Central to frontend state management, it was updated to store API keys in local storage, send them with backend requests, trim whitespace from keys, and dynamically set default AI models based on the selected provider. Also fixed an incorrect backend URL.
-   ****: New file, integrates the Monaco Editor for a code editing experience.
-   ****: New file, implements a tree-view for file navigation. Icon import errors (, ) were fixed by replacing them with available Chakra UI icons.
-   ****: Modified to integrate the  and  components, forming the Development Environment.
-   ****: Modified multiple times to implement the dark mode with gold accents and later to precisely match the Emergent.sh design.
-   ****: Updated to integrate the new  for the application's main structure.
-   ****: New file, specifically created to clone the design and layout of Emergent.sh, including the collapsible sidebar, main chat area, and dark/light theme toggle.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a major design overhaul, cloning the exact layout and aesthetic of Emergent.sh. This involved:
1.  **Creating new layout components:**  was implemented to provide a left sidebar navigation, main content area, and a dark/light theme toggle, all responsive.
2.  **Updating global styles and themes:**  and  were adjusted to achieve a luxurious black and gold color scheme, consistent with the Emergent.sh branding.
3.  **Integrating the new layout:**  was modified to use the newly created  as the primary application wrapper.
4.  **Creating auxiliary components and scripts:**  was created, and  was developed to start services and demonstrate the new UI.
5.  **Documenting the design:**  was created to detail the implemented design features.

The outcome is a visually distinct application that closely mirrors the desired Emergent.sh UI/UX, featuring a gold E logo, Emergent AI PLATFORM branding, a functional sidebar, and a theme toggle. The AI engineer also confirmed that previously fixed bugs (API key integration, model selection, database boolean checks) were resolved, making the chat functionality ready for use once API keys are configured. The immediate task given by the user is to perform a comprehensive code audit of the entire codebase.
