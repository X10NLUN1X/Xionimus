# Test Results and Communication Log

## User Problem Statement
The user wants to implement the **Development Environment** module for their "Emergent-like" system with the following specifications:

### Requirements:
- **File Storage**: Local server storage (no cloud integration initially)
- **Code Editor**: Monaco Editor (VS Code-like experience with powerful extensions)
- **File Size Limits**: Maximum 250 MB per upload with chunked upload support
- **Version Control**: Simple file versioning (incremental storage, restore/compare)
- **LLM Integration**: Direct API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic & Perplexity for AI code features (refactoring, comments)

### Current State:
- Backend has basic file upload/download functionality (`files.py`)
- Backend has workspace management API (`workspace.py`) 
- Frontend has placeholder pages for Files and Workspace
- Current file size limit is 50MB (needs to be increased to 250MB)

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Guidelines:
1. **ALWAYS** use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for backend API testing
2. **Test sequence**: Core API endpoints ‚Üí File operations ‚Üí Monaco integration ‚Üí Versioning
3. **Focus areas**: File upload (chunked), workspace tree, Monaco editor integration, file versioning

### Frontend Testing Guidelines:
1. Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for UI/UX testing
2. **Test sequence**: Component rendering ‚Üí File operations ‚Üí Editor functionality ‚Üí User workflows
3. **Focus areas**: Monaco Editor integration, TreeView functionality, File upload UI, Versioning interface

### Communication Protocol:
- **Update this file** before each testing agent invocation
- **Record findings** from each testing cycle
- **Track integration progress** with third-party services
- **Document any workarounds** or pending issues

## Current Test Results

*No testing completed yet - Implementation starting*

## Incorporate User Feedback
- User confirmed preferences for Monaco Editor and local storage
- User specified 250MB file size limit requirement
- User wants direct API key integration (not Emergent LLM key)
- User prioritizes VS Code-like experience with extensions

## Next Steps
1. Update backend file size limit configuration
2. Install Monaco Editor dependencies  
3. Begin Monaco Editor component implementation
4. Test enhanced file operations
5. Proceed with systematic testing using testing agents
