The AI engineer's work involved an iterative process of debugging, feature implementation, and responding to user feedback for the Xionimus AI application. Key initial efforts focused on resolving a frontend API_BASE is not defined error. Extensive work was dedicated to refining Advanced Session Management, including fixing SQLAlchemy ORM usage, linking sessions to user IDs, and resolving complex FastAPI routing conflicts and ID mismatches between frontend and backend. The  integration was stabilized, addressing Windows-specific installation issues. The workflow for the Research Agent was enhanced to offer explicit options and post-code actions. UI improvements included a split-screen research panel and a darker color theme. Finally, the engineer was actively addressing a persistent authentication warning by planning automatic frontend logout on 401 errors.

The primary goal was to debug and enhance the Xionimus AI application, a full-stack platform (React frontend, FastAPI backend, SQLite for sessions).
Initial Problem: Login/session persistence not working correctly, with  values not being utilized for sessions.
Subsequent Feature Requests:
1.  **Claude API Errors**: Investigate and fix reported errors in the Claude/Anthropic API integration, including API key passing,  parameter issues, and  vs.  conflicts.
2.  **UI Cleanup & Features**: Remove all model names and dropdown menus from the user interface. Implement an intelligent auto-scroll during streaming. Create a split-screen interface with a live research activity panel. Display clickable post-code options (Debugging, Improvement, Other) and clickable research options. Adjust UI colors (e.g., brighten cyan).
3.  **Precise Token Counter**: Implement an accurate token counter using actual API token counts () instead of estimation, resolving cross-platform installation issues (e.g., Windows ).
4.  **Advanced Session Management**: Automatically save/overwrite user sessions after each chat input. Allow users to select and continue sessions from a history tab, ensuring sessions are linked to the logged-in user and persist across reloads. Display a context warning when 80% of the context limit is reached. Provide a clickable Session Summary option in chat to summarize the session and initiate a new session with summarized knowledge.
5.  **Environment Stability & CI/CD Fixes**: Address recurring GitHub CI/CD pipeline failures and backend startup errors, aiming for automated fixes on startup. Deactivate irrelevant auto-code review warnings.
6.  **Workflow Logic**: Ensure the Research Agent workflow offers research options before coding and prevents premature code reviews. Prevent double assistant responses during small talk.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a persistent authentication issue where the backend logs showed: . This indicates that the frontend was sending requests with a valid-looking JWT token that corresponded to a user ID no longer present in the database (likely due to a database reset or user deletion). The engineer had already refined the error message in  to be more descriptive. The current task is to implement a client-side solution: modify the frontend ( or similar) to automatically log out the user and clear their local session/token whenever a 401 Unauthorized response is received from any backend API call. This prevents the frontend from repeatedly making requests with an invalid token, improving the robustness of the authentication flow.
