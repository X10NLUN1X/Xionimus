The trajectory documents the comprehensive evolution of the Xionimus AI application. Initially deemed feature-complete, a user request prompted a pivot towards a local-first desktop application, guided by a 4-sprint roadmap.

Sprint 1 established the foundation by migrating from MongoDB to a local SQLite database, adding a theme toggle, and implementing core UX features. Sprint 2 introduced real-time streaming via WebSockets and was later completed with file uploads, lazy loading, and setup scripts. Sprints 3 and 4 rapidly built out advanced AI capabilities, including multi-modal support (PDFs/images), a RAG system with ChromaDB, context management, workspaces, and a clipboard assistant.

A significant portion of the work involved a user-directed, systematic end-to-end debugging phase conducted in German. This phase identified and fixed numerous issues, including UI layout problems (moving the chat input to the homepage), i18n translation errors, React Router warnings, and a critical bug where the file dropzone blocked user input. A final pre-deployment check addressed a  bug, hardcoded URLs, and missing configuration files like .

The most recent task involves resolving critical installation and runtime errors on Windows, including Python dependency failures (, , ) and incorrect path handling in batch scripts. The AI's initial attempt to fix this was unsuccessful, as shown by the user's latest error logs.

The primary objective is to transform Xionimus AI from a standard web application into a powerful, stable, and feature-rich tool optimized for local desktop use. Development follows a pre-approved 4-sprint plan (Option D: Full Package) to systematically achieve this vision.

**Completed Work:**
The entire 4-sprint plan has been implemented. This includes:
*   **Sprint 1 (Foundation):** Migrated persistence to a local SQLite database, added a dark/light theme, keyboard shortcuts, and message action controls.
*   **Sprint 2 (Performance & Files):** Implemented real-time streaming responses (WebSockets), drag-and-drop file uploads, lazy loading for messages, and one-click setup scripts.
*   **Sprint 3 (AI Power-Features):** Integrated multi-modal support for images/PDFs, a local RAG pipeline using ChromaDB, and smart context management.
*   **Sprint 4 (Polish & Innovation):** Added workspace management, a clipboard assistant, and system tray integration stubs.

**Current Goal:**
The application is now in a comprehensive debugging and hardening phase to ensure production-readiness, with a specific focus on achieving full functionality and a seamless installation experience on Windows environments.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main user interface for all chat interactions.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This file has been extensively modified. It was refactored to include the drag-and-drop file upload UI, lazy-loading components, and the chat input was duplicated to appear on the initial welcome screen per the user's request. A bug related to  was also fixed here.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Provides the drag-and-drop file upload functionality.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This component was completely rewritten. The initial implementation using the  library blocked mouse clicks on underlying elements. It was replaced with a custom implementation using native HTML5 Drag and Drop APIs to resolve the issue.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Handles core chat message processing.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** A critical pre-deployment bug was fixed here where  was being used without being extracted from the request body, which would have broken session continuity.

-   ** & **
    -   **Importance:** These scripts are intended to provide a one-click setup and run experience on Windows.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Created to address Windows compatibility issues. However, user feedback indicates they are failing due to incorrect path assumptions and dependency installation problems.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the failing Windows installation script (), which currently fails to find the project directory when run as administrator.
- Resolve the Python dependency errors in . Specifically,  cannot be found, and  is not being installed correctly despite a dependency check being in place.
- Correct the logic in the Windows scripts to ensure they are run from the project root directory.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on debugging and fixing the broken Windows installation and backend startup process. The previous AI engineer created several new files (, , ) to address Windows-specific issues like the  library incompatibility.

However, the user has provided fresh error logs indicating these fixes are not working.
The key problems identified are:
1.  **:** When run with admin rights, it incorrectly identifies  as the project root and fails because it cannot find the  directory.
2.  **:** The backend fails to start due to multiple  issues. The dependency installation step fails to find a version for  and subsequently fails to import , even though a check for dependencies was supposedly added to the script.

The current task is to analyze these specific errors and create functional, robust versions of the Windows batch scripts that correctly handle paths and Python dependencies.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Analyze the provided error logs for the Windows scripts and implement immediate fixes. I will start by correcting the path detection logic in  and then fix the dependency installation failures in .
