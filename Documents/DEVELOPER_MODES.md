## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

**1. New File: `/app/backend/app/core/developer_mode.py`**
```python
class DeveloperModeManager:
    MODES = {
        "junior": {
            "model": "claude-haiku-3.5-20241022",
            "ultra_thinking": False,
            "smart_routing": False
        },
        "senior": {
            "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
            "ultra_thinking": True,
            "smart_routing": True  # Auto-upgrade to Opus for complex tasks
        }
    }
```

**2. Updated: `/app/backend/app/api/chat.py`**
- Added `developer_mode` field to `ChatRequest`
- Auto-configures provider/model/ultra_thinking based on mode
- Smart routing only enabled for Senior mode

**3. New Endpoint: `/app/backend/app/api/developer_modes.py`**
- `GET /api/developer-modes/` - Get available modes
- `GET /api/developer-modes/comparison` - Detailed comparison

### Frontend Changes

**1. New Component: `/app/frontend/src/components/DeveloperModeToggle.tsx`**
- Visual toggle between Junior/Senior modes
- Tooltips explaining each mode
- Color-coded buttons (Green = Junior, Blue = Senior)

**2. Updated: `/app/frontend/src/contexts/AppContext.tsx`**
- Added `developerMode` state (default: "senior")
- Sends developer_mode with all chat requests

**3. Updated: `/app/frontend/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`**
- Integrated DeveloperModeToggle in header
- Mode selection persists across session

---

## 🎨 User Experience

### Mode Selection UI

```
Header: [🌱 Junior] [🚀 Senior] (Toggle buttons)
        ↓                ↓
     Green            Blue
    (Active)        (Inactive)
```

**Tooltips:**
- **Junior**: "Fast & Budget-Friendly (Claude Haiku) - 73% cheaper, perfect for learning and simple tasks"
- **Senior**: "Premium Quality (Claude Sonnet 4.5 + Opus 4.1) - Best for production code, complex debugging"

### Behavior Differences

#### Junior Mode 🌱
```
User: "Create a simple calculator app"
System: Uses Claude Haiku 3.5 (fast & cheap)
       No smart routing
       No ultra-thinking
Result: Quick, cost-effective response
```

#### Senior Mode 🚀
```
User: "My auth system is broken, getting 500 errors..."
System: Starts with Claude Sonnet 4.5
       Detects complexity → Auto-upgrades to Opus 4.1
       Ultra-thinking enabled
Result: Deep analysis, thorough debugging
```

## 🔍 Research System Updates

### Perplexity Deep Research as Default

**Before:**
```
Research → Perplexity sonar/sonar-pro (based on choice)
```

**After:**
```
Research → Perplexity sonar-deep-research (always)
           ↓ (on failure)
           Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 (fallback)
```

**Implementation:**
```python
try:
    # Primary: Perplexity Deep Research
    research_response = await ai_manager.generate_response(
        provider="perplexity",
        model="sonar-deep-research",
        messages=[research_prompt]
    )
except Exception:
    # Fallback: Anthropic Claude
    research_response = await ai_manager.generate_response(
        provider="anthropic",
        model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
        messages=[research_prompt]
    )
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Junior Mode - Simple Task
```typescript
// Frontend request
{
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is React?"}],
  "developer_mode": "junior"
}

// Backend processing
✅ Junior Mode: Claude Haiku 3.5
✅ No smart routing
✅ Ultra-thinking: OFF
Response: Fast, cost-effective answer
```

### Example 2: Senior Mode - Complex Debugging
```typescript
// Frontend request
{
  "messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "My authentication system has 500 errors, database connection seems fine..."
  }],
  "developer_mode": "senior"
}

// Backend processing
✅ Senior Mode: Claude Sonnet 4.5
🚀 Complexity detected → Upgraded to Opus 4.1
✅ Ultra-thinking: ON
Response: Deep analysis, comprehensive debugging
```

### Example 3: Research Request
```typescript
// Any research request
{
  "research_choice": "large"
}

// Backend processing
1. Try: Perplexity sonar-deep-research
2. If fails → Fallback: Claude Sonnet 4.5
Result: Comprehensive research with citations
```
