## 🚀 New Features

### Claude Model Lineup

| Model | Purpose | Cost | Use Case |
|-------|---------|------|----------|
| **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | ✅ DEFAULT | $9/1M tokens | Standard tasks, general coding |
| **Claude Opus 4.1** | 🚀 ULTIMATE | $15/1M tokens | Complex debugging, architecture |
| **Claude Haiku 3.5** | ⚡ FAST | $2.40/1M tokens | Simple tasks, quick responses |

### Smart Routing Intelligence

The new `ClaudeRouter` automatically upgrades from Sonnet to Opus when detecting:

**1. Long Messages** (>1000 characters)
- Indicates comprehensive tasks requiring deep analysis

**2. Complexity Indicators** (2+ keyword matches)
- "refactor", "architect", "debug complex", "root cause"
- "comprehensive analysis", "deep dive", "thorough review"
- "solve complex", "not working", "broken", "failing"
- "research", "strategy", "migration plan"

**3. Code Generation + Errors**
- When user requests code changes AND mentions errors/bugs
- Requires deeper understanding and debugging

**4. Long Conversations** (>5 user messages in last 10)
- If Sonnet struggles, escalate to Opus for better results

**5. Multi-Step Tasks** (2+ step indicators)
- "multiple files", "step by step", "first then next"
- "phase", "stage", "all files"

### Automatic Fallback Chain

```
Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Default)
    ↓ (on failure)
Claude Opus 4.1 (Smart Router)
    ↓ (on failure)
OpenAI GPT-4o (Ultimate Fallback)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

**1. `/app/backend/app/core/ai_manager.py`**
```python
# Added Claude Opus 4.1
"anthropic": [
    "claude-haiku-3.5-20241022",
    "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",     # ✅ DEFAULT
    "claude-opus-4-1"                 # 🚀 ULTIMATE
]
```

**2. `/app/backend/app/api/chat.py`**
```python
# Updated defaults
provider: str = Field(default="anthropic")  # Changed from "openai"
model: str = Field(default="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929")  # Changed from "gpt-4o-mini"
ultra_thinking: bool = True  # Changed from False
```

**3. `/app/backend/app/core/claude_router.py` (NEW)**
- Smart routing class with complexity detection
- Task analysis based on keywords, length, context
- Automatic model recommendation
- Fallback model selection

**4. Chat Endpoint Enhancements**
- Integrated Claude router before AI calls
- Try-catch fallback mechanism
- Automatic retry with better model on failure

### Frontend Changes

**1. `/app/frontend/src/contexts/AppContext.tsx`**
```typescript
// Updated defaults
const [selectedProvider, setSelectedProvider] = useState('anthropic')
const [selectedModel, setSelectedModel] = useState('claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929')
```

**2. `/app/frontend/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`**
```typescript
// Ultra-thinking enabled by default
const [ultraThinking, setUltraThinking] = useState(true)
```

## 📊 Smart Routing Examples

### Example 1: Simple Query → Sonnet 4.5
```
User: "What is React?"
Router: ✅ Standard task → Sonnet 4.5
```

### Example 2: Complex Debugging → Opus 4.1
```
User: "My authentication system is broken. Users can't login and I'm getting 
500 errors. I've tried checking the database connection, JWT tokens, and CORS 
but nothing works. Please help debug this."
Router: 🚀 Complexity indicators: "broken", "not working", "error" + Long message
Result: Upgraded to Opus 4.1
```

### Example 3: Multi-Step Architecture → Opus 4.1
```
User: "Design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform. 
First, plan the service boundaries. Then, design the API gateway. 
Next, implement the database strategy. Finally, add monitoring."
Router: 🚀 Multi-step indicators: "First", "Then", "Next", "Finally"
Result: Upgraded to Opus 4.1
```

### Example 4: Auto Fallback
```
Request: Sonnet 4.5 → ❌ API Error
Fallback: Opus 4.1 → ✅ Success
```

## 🎨 User Experience Changes

### Before Phase 2
- Default: GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI)
- Ultra-thinking: OFF (manual toggle)
- No smart routing
- Manual model selection required

### After Phase 2
- Default: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic) 🎯
- Ultra-thinking: ON by default 🧠
- Smart routing: Automatic Sonnet → Opus for complex tasks 🚀
- Automatic fallback: Robust error handling ✅
