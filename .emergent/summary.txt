The trajectory chronicles a comprehensive stabilization and feature development effort for the Xionimus AI application. The work began with an extensive code audit, executed in four distinct phases. Phase 1 focused on critical bug fixes, primarily completing a stalled database migration from MongoDB to SQLAlchemy, which resolved core chat functionality issues. This involved refactoring API endpoints (, ), setting a , and cleaning up deprecated database code. Phase 2 addressed high-priority tasks like removing dead code and improving error handling by replacing generic exceptions with specific ones in . Phase 3 verified existing stability features like TypeScript's strict mode and frontend error boundaries, and identified stale dependencies. This was followed by a conservative update of both backend and frontend packages. Phase 4 made the application production-ready by enhancing the health check endpoint with system monitoring (using ), adding unit tests with ============================= test session starts ==============================

The project's direction then pivoted dramatically. The user provided a new specification for an integrated, multi-agent AI Code-Review-System. The engineer adopted the role of Agent-Manager and, upon user confirmation, proceeded to implement a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for this new feature. This involved creating new backend models, core agent logic, API endpoints, and a corresponding frontend page with navigation, successfully integrating the new functionality's foundation into the existing application structure.
</analysis>
<product_requirements>
The initial product goal was to enhance a functional MVP by adding GitHub integration features (Fork Summary and Push to GitHub) and a UI for managing credentials. However, the discovery of critical bugs that rendered the core chat feature unusable shifted the primary requirement to application stabilization.

This led to a multi-phase code audit aimed at achieving production readiness. The requirements were to:
1.  Complete the database migration from MongoDB to SQLAlchemy to ensure data consistency and fix chat errors.
2.  Systematically audit the entire codebase to remove dead code, improve error handling, update stale dependencies, and secure the application.
3.  Enhance observability with a detailed health check endpoint and establish a unit testing foundation.

After achieving stability, the user introduced a major new feature requirement: to build and integrate an AI-powered Code Review System directly into the application. This system needed its own backend logic for orchestrating multiple AI agents (analysis, debug, etc.), API endpoints for processing review requests, and a dedicated frontend page for user interaction. The final implemented work was an MVP of this new Code Review feature.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend:** React (Vite), TypeScript, Chakra UI
- **Database:** SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM (fully migrated from MongoDB)
- **Testing:** Pytest for backend unit tests.
- **System Monitoring:**  library integrated into a comprehensive  endpoint.
- **AI Integration:** A new multi-agent system architecture for code analysis.
</key_technical_concepts>
<code_architecture>
The application is a standard monorepo with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. The key architectural shift was the completed migration to a unified SQLAlchemy/SQLite database, eliminating all legacy MongoDB code. The most recent and significant addition is the new Code Review System module.

<current_work>
The engineer has just completed the initial implementation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a new, AI-powered Code Review System, as requested by the user. This work represents a significant feature addition after a lengthy period of stabilization and code auditing.

The implementation included:
1.  **Backend Development:**
    -   New SQLAlchemy models () were created to store review data.
    -   A core logic module () was built to define the structure and prompts for the multi-agent analysis system.
    -   A new FastAPI router () was added to expose the functionality via API endpoints.
    -   The new models and router were integrated into the main application (, ), and the database tables were created upon backend restart.

2.  **Frontend Development:**
    -   A new page component () was created to serve as the UI for this feature.
    -   The page was made accessible by adding a new route in  and a navigation button in the  sidebar.

The work concluded with a successful backend restart and a screenshot confirming that the new, empty Code Review page loads correctly in the browser. The system is foundational and not yet interactive; the frontend is not yet wired to the backend API.

<optional_next_step>
Connect the frontend  form to the newly created backend API endpoints in  to enable users to submit code and receive analysis results.
