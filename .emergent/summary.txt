<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully guided the user from an initial request for a desktop application to a fully functional, localized, web-based AI assistant named Xionimus AI. Initially, the AI clarified platform limitations and pivoted to building a web application with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Key decisions involved integrating Perplexity and Claude APIs, implementing a multi-agent system with intelligent model allocation (Perplexity for research/chat, Claude for coding/writing), and applying several design transformations from a dark theme to a futuristic, then a dystopian cyberpunk aesthetic. The AI also added GitHub integration, file upload, and a session fork system for local persistence. Finally, it created comprehensive installation guides and scripts, and provided a detailed explanation of the local storage and context management mechanisms. The process involved extensive file modifications and additions across both frontend and backend to integrate new features and apply design changes.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a Desktop application from Emergent, with all functions with an API interface for Perplexity and Claude. Due to platform limitations, the AI engineer proposed and the user agreed to build a web application with similar functionality.

The web application's requirements evolved:
1.  **Core Functionality**: Replicate Emergent-like features, including chat, code, and project management.
2.  **API Integrations**: Integrate Perplexity and Claude APIs using user-provided keys, with the application designed for private use, decoupled from Emergent.
3.  **UI/UX**: Implement a modern, responsive UI with a dark theme initially, evolving to a futuristic design, then to a dystopian cyberpunk aesthetic with specific visual elements (Matrix-style background, glitch effects, specific color palette, custom font Xionimus AI).
4.  **Agent System**: Implement an intelligent agent system (similar to ) with specialized agents capable of automatic language detection and task-based routing.
5.  **LLM Allocation**: Assign Perplexity for research, testing, chat, and communication, and Claude for coding, writing, and data analysis. Other agents should be defined for maximum effectiveness.
6.  **Branding**: Rename the project and app to Xionimus AI with a specific font and theme.
7.  **New Features**: Add GitHub integration, file upload functionality, and a fork function for session backup/restore.
8.  **Installation & Documentation**: Simplify installation and provide comprehensive guides and automated scripts.
9.  **Local Persistence**: Ensure all data (projects, messages, files, sessions, user settings) is stored locally on the hard drive, providing infinite context through intelligent context management and session forks, despite AI model context limits.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **AI Integration**: Perplexity API, Anthropic Claude API.
-   **UI Framework**: Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Agentic AI**: Multi-agent system with intelligent task routing and LLM allocation.
-   **Local Persistence**: MongoDB for data, file system for uploads/sessions.
-   **Context Management**: Smart Context Loading from local storage.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   : The core FastAPI application. It was significantly modified to include new API endpoints for chat, agent management, project handling, file uploads, and session management. It now integrates LLM agents and handles API key configuration from environment variables.
-   : A new directory created to house the specialized AI agents.
    -   : Crucial for orchestrating agent selection based on user input, and directing requests to the appropriate LLM (Perplexity or Claude).
    -   , , , , , , , : New agent files defining their specific functionalities and designated LLM models.
-   : The main React component underwent substantial changes to implement the UI for chat, code, projects, new GitHub, Files, and Fork tabs. It also includes logic for agent selection, API calls to the backend, dynamic styling based on the design theme, and displays agent-specific information.
-   : Extensively modified to implement the various design themes (dark, futuristic, dystopian cyberpunk), including custom fonts (Orbitron), background effects (scanlines, radial gradients), glitch effects for branding, and styling for buttons and other UI elements.
-    & : Updated to manage API keys for Perplexity and Anthropic, and ensure proper URL configuration without hardcoding.
-    & : Updated with new dependencies required for LLM integration, UI components, and other functionalities.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed the implementation of the Xionimus AI application, adhering to the user's latest requests. The current state of the product is a fully functional, web-based AI assistant with a dystopian cyberpunk design.

Key aspects of the current work and product state:
-   **Branding & Design**: The app is named Xionimus AI, featuring a dystopian cyberpunk theme with a Matrix-style background, scanlines, glitch effects for the branding, and a green-red-violet terminal-style color palette. The Orbitron font is used for a futuristic look.
-   **Agent System**: An advanced agent system is implemented with 8 specialized agents: Code, Research, Writing, Data, QA, GitHub, File, and Session Agents.
-   **LLM Allocation**: Perplexity AI is used for the Research Agent, QA Agent, GitHub Agent, and for general chat and communication. Claude AI is assigned to the Code Agent, Writing Agent, Data Agent, File Agent, and Session Agent.
-   **New Features**:
    -   **GitHub Integration**: Allows repository management directly within the UI.
    -   **File Upload System**: Supports drag-and-drop file uploads and basic file management.
    -   **Session Fork System**: Provides full session backup/restore functionality, enabling users to save and load complete states (projects, chat history, files, agent configurations, settings) for continuous work.
-   **Local Persistence**: All application data, including chat histories, projects, code files, uploaded files, and session states, is stored locally in a MongoDB database () and the file system (, ).
-   **Context Management**: An intelligent context loading mechanism is in place to provide relevant historical data to the AI models within their token limits, making the local storage effectively infinite for user data, even if the LLM context window is limited per turn.
-   **Installation**: Simplified installation with one-click scripts (, , ) and detailed documentation (, , ).
-   **User Interface**: The frontend features 6 navigation tabs (CHAT, CODE, PROJ, GIT, FILES, FORK), cyberpunk-styled buttons, and status indicators with blinking lights. Terminal-style messages are displayed for system feedback.

The user's last interaction was a clarifying question about the local persistence and infinite context, which the AI engineer thoroughly answered.
