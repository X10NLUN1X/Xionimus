The trajectory outlines a comprehensive debugging and refactoring process for a full-stack AI chat application. The initial user request, provided in German, was to perform a deep debug, remove dependencies on Emergent LLM Keys in favor of direct API integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity), ensure frontend-backend communication is stable, add  attributes for testability, clean up the repository by deleting old tests and reports, and create new documentation.

The AI engineer systematically tackled these tasks. It first confirmed the application already used direct API integrations, simplifying the scope. It then proceeded with a multi-phase plan:
1.  **Cleanup:** Removed numerous old test files and markdown reports.
2.  **Frontend Enhancements:** Added  attributes to key React components for improved test automation.
3.  **Backend & Cross-Platform Fixes:** Addressed multiple critical bugs, including a  import error on startup, a  on Windows due to a hardcoded  path, and a  by specifying UTF-8 encoding for file operations.
4.  **Frontend Bug Fixes:** Resolved a React Invalid hook call error, a crash in the  component by adding null safety checks, and a UI update bug when regenerating responses.
5.  **API & Connection Stability:** Fixed a WebSocket 403 Forbidden error, repeatedly increased the Perplexity API timeout as requested, and resolved several breaking changes in the Anthropic API regarding temperature, token limits, and response parsing.
6.  **Feature Enhancements:** Improved the post-coding summary and the reliability of file path detection from AI-generated code.

The work was iterative, with the user providing error logs and the AI diagnosing and fixing them in sequence. The final request was to ensure only the Claude model is used for coding tasks.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to stabilize, refactor, and prepare the Xionimus AI application for a production-ready release. The application is a sophisticated AI-powered code review and generation tool with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and integrations with multiple LLM providers.

**Core Requirements:**
1.  **Full System Audit & Debugging:** Perform a comprehensive analysis of the entire codebase, identify all bugs, and fix them on the fly.
2.  **API Integration Refactoring:** The application must be completely independent of any Emergent services. All LLM calls (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity) must be made directly to the providers' APIs.
3.  **Connection Stability:** Verify and stabilize all communication channels, including internal frontend-to-backend API calls and external calls from the backend to third-party AI services.
4.  **Enhanced Testability:** Instrument the frontend React components with  attributes to facilitate automated testing.
5.  **Repository Cleanup:** Remove all obsolete test files, mock data, and outdated markdown reports from the repository.
6.  **New Documentation:** Create a concise, up-to-date set of documentation covering the project's current status, API key setup, and deployment readiness.
7.  **Platform Compatibility:** Ensure the application runs smoothly on both Linux and Windows environments, addressing any OS-specific issues.
8.  **Model Usage Constraint:** For all code generation tasks, the application must exclusively use the Anthropic Claude model.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Application:** React (Frontend) & FastAPI (Backend).
- **Database:** SQLite (inferred from file structure).
- **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets for streaming chat responses.
- **Third-Party API Integration:** Direct integration with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity APIs.
- **Frontend State Management:** React Context API ().
- **UI Framework:** Chakra UI.
- **Backend Environment:** Python with  and  for process management.
- **Testability:** Use of  attributes for automated UI testing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monorepo structure with separate directories for the frontend and backend.



- ****
    - **Importance:** This is the central hub for managing interactions with all third-party LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity). It contains the logic for formatting requests, sending them, and parsing responses.
    - **Changes:** This file was modified multiple times to:
        - Increase the Perplexity API timeout from 60 to 300, and finally to 900 seconds.
        - Fix multiple breaking changes in the Anthropic API, including adjusting the  parameter, ensuring  > , and correctly parsing the  object.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Handles the extraction, processing, and saving of code blocks generated by the AI.
    - **Changes:**
        - Added  to  calls to fix Unicode encoding errors on Windows.
        - Improved the  function to provide more context (purpose of the code, suggested next steps).
        - Enhanced the regex pattern () and the  function to more reliably extract file paths from AI responses.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Manages the global state for the frontend application, including chat sessions, messages, API keys, and WebSocket connections.
    - **Changes:** An  function was added to allow components to modify the global message state. This was necessary to fix a bug where the UI would not refresh after a regenerate response action.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The main user interface for the chat functionality.
    - **Changes:** The  function was updated to use the new  function from , ensuring the chat view updates correctly.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Displays the list of past chat sessions.
    - **Changes:** Added optional chaining (, ) to prevent crashes when a chat session contains no messages.

- ****
    - **Importance:** A critical component for catching and handling React rendering errors.
    - **Changes:** The component was refactored to resolve an Invalid hook call error. The original implementation was a class component incorrectly trying to use React hooks. It was fixed by converting parts of it to a functional component wrapper.

<pending_tasks>
- **Enforce Claude for Coding:** The primary pending task is to modify the backend logic to ensure that all code generation tasks are exclusively handled by the Anthropic Claude model, as per the user's latest request.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's new requirement: **He also codes with GPT, he should exclusively use Claude for coding.**

The work started with identifying the part of the backend responsible for selecting the AI model for a given task. The engineer used  to search for keywords like coding, code generation, and select provider within the  directory.

The search results pointed towards , specifically a section around line 333 that handles intelligent agent selection. The next logical step identified was to investigate the  file, which likely contains the core logic for routing tasks to different LLM providers (like GPT or Claude). The current task is to analyze this logic and modify it to force the selection of Claude for any requests identified as coding. No code has been modified for this task yet; the work is in the analysis phase.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Continue the investigation into  to locate the provider selection logic and implement a rule to exclusively use the claude provider for all coding-related tasks.
