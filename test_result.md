    message: "Performance improvements testing completed successfully. Key findings: 1) Performance monitoring is active and working correctly, 2) Input responsiveness excellent at 39.42ms average per character, 3) Memoized components prevent unnecessary re-renders effectively, 4) Chat interface loads and functions properly, 5) WebSocket connection fails but HTTP fallback works. Minor React Hooks warning in TokenUsageWidget needs attention but doesn't affect performance. WebSocket 403 error requires backend investigation."
