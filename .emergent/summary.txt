The AI engineer successfully transformed Xionimus AI from a local agent to a web-based platform. This involved a major frontend UI/UX overhaul from Chakra UI to a custom glossy black-gold theme using Tailwind CSS, systematically migrating numerous components, fixing a critical  file watcher error, and addressing mobile responsiveness issues. Key features like Code and Logs View panels with syntax highlighting and automatic code extraction were implemented. Backend was thoroughly tested and optimized to 100% success, including performance improvements and CORS configuration. The conversation concluded with the user requesting an Agenten Phase to integrate test agents and sub-agents, particularly a Research Agent using Perplexity Sonar Deep Research, with specific UI requirements derived from provided images.

<product_requirements>
The Xionimus AI project aimed to pivot from a local agent to a fully web-based, cloud-native platform, incorporating a Cloud Backend, Web Client (Dashboard with Chat, Code, Logs), Session Engine, Cloud Sandbox, Collaboration Layer, Plugin/API Integration, and Deployment/Scaling. The cloud backend with PostgreSQL and Redis, LLM routing (Claude AI), API Key Management (with Fernet encryption), and a Cloud Sandbox (supporting 12 languages) are established. The core problem addressed in this trajectory was the comprehensive implementation and refinement of the Web Client's UI. This involved a complete redesign from Chakra UI to a custom glossy Black Golden Web interface with Xionimus AI centered in the header, ensuring an interactive, intuitive, and professional user experience, with a focus on mobile responsiveness and enhanced animations. The current goal is to add an Agenten phase with a Research Agent integrated into the UI.

<code_architecture>
The project is a full-stack  monorepo with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, using PostgreSQL and Redis. The UI is built with React and Tailwind CSS, transitioning from Chakra UI.



-   : Extensively modified to remove Chakra UI components and integrate custom glossy Tailwind designs. This includes the welcome screen, chat view header, message display, input area, action buttons, and drawer toggles. It now imports new UI components and . Significant refactoring for mobile responsiveness was also done here.
-   : Modified to be mobile-optimized, showing icons only on smaller screens.
-    (New): Implements a side drawer for displaying code, now integrated with Prism.js for syntax highlighting.
-    (New): Implements a side drawer for displaying logs.
-    (New/Modified): A new directory for reusable glossy UI components (e.g., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ).  was updated for Chakra UI compatibility.
-   : Contains global Tailwind directives and custom CSS for animations and Prism.js syntax highlighting.
-   : Configures Tailwind CSS with custom glossy theme colors and enhanced animation keyframes.
-    (New): Utility function to extract code snippets from chat messages.
-   : Documentation added for CORS configuration to explicitly mention production origins.
-   : Modified to introduce a background task for periodic system metric updates to improve performance of the  endpoint.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with initiating a new Agenten Phase by the user. This phase involves integrating test agents and sub-agents, with a specific focus on a Research Agent. The Research Agent is expected to leverage Perplexity Sonar Deep Research and present its findings with a UI mirroring several user-provided images. The current action was to analyze these images to thoroughly understand the desired visual design, layout, and information display patterns for the Research Agent's interface. This is the very beginning of planning for this new agent integration.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Create a detailed implementation plan for integrating the Research Agent and its associated UI, based on the image analysis.
