The AI engineer successfully navigated a major product pivot for Xionimus AI, shifting from a local agent to a web-based, cloud-native platform. This involved establishing a robust backend with PostgreSQL and Redis, implementing advanced LLM functionalities including smart routing and developer modes, and systematically removing all remnants of the deprecated local agent. Subsequently, the engineer delivered a fully functional Cloud Sandbox supporting 12 programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Bash, C++, C#, C, Perl, Java, Go, PHP, Ruby, TypeScript) with compilation and execution capabilities, as well as code templates and STDIN support. Finally, a complete backend API for API Key Management (including encryption) was developed and integrated, and the engineer is currently working on its corresponding frontend UI, addressing various bugs and improving code quality throughout the process.

<product_requirements>
The Xionimus AI project initially focused on hardening and developing a local Windows autonomous agent (like GitHub Copilot). However, a significant pivot mandated a **fully web-based, cloud-native platform**, akin to emergent.sh. The revised roadmap includes: Cloud Backend, Web Client (Dashboard with Chat, Code, Logs), Session Engine, Cloud Sandbox, Collaboration Layer, Plugin/API Integration, and Deployment/Scaling. So far, the cloud backend with PostgreSQL and Redis is established, LLM routing and developer modes are implemented, and the local agent components have been removed. API keys are now to be managed via a UI, rather than hardcoded. The current focus is on implementing the Web Client (UI for API Key Management) and the Cloud Sandbox.

<key_technical_concepts>
- FastAPI (Python Backend)
- React (TypeScript Frontend)
- PostgreSQL (Primary Database, migrated from SQLite)
- Redis (Caching/Session Management)
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- Claude AI (Sonnet, Opus, Haiku, for smart routing/developer modes)
- Subprocess-based Sandboxing (for code execution)
- Encryption (for API Key Management)
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is a full-stack  monorepo with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. It utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary database (migrated from SQLite) and Redis for session management.


**Key Files and Changes:**
- : Updated with Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity API keys, GITHUB_TOKEN, and ENCRYPTION_KEY.
- : Registers new API routers (, , , ), removed agent routers, initializes Redis.
- : Modified to correctly integrate  and  logic, skipping research workflow when explicit modes are set.
- : Added a PATCH endpoint to update  and  in sessions; fixed session listing API to select these fields. Also, fixed  to  references.
-  (New): Handles code execution requests in a subprocess-based sandbox.
-  (New): Provides API endpoints for fetching code templates. Auth initially required, then kept due to global middleware.
-  (New): Implements CRUD operations for encrypted user API keys, using  for authentication.
-  (New): API for session forking, fixed to use  and correct database dependency injection.
-  (New): Manages execution of code for 12 languages (Python, JS, Bash, C++, C#, C, Perl, Java, Go, PHP, Ruby, TypeScript), including compilation, resource limits, and environment variables (e.g., , Java memory settings, ).
-  (New): Defines predefined code templates.
-  (New): Provides utilities for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data like API keys.
- : Updated to create the  table.
-  (New): Pydantic and SQLAlchemy models for storing encrypted user API keys.
-  (New): React component to display code execution results, integrated with Run Code button.
- : Extended to include Run Code button and language selection for sandbox integration.
- : Fixed React Hooks order warning ( moved out of event handler).
- : Modified to gracefully handle context status errors.
-  (New): React page for managing API keys and other settings.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Implement Phase 3: Web Client (Dashboard with Chat, Code, Logs), focusing on remaining UI for API key input.
- Implement Phase 5: Collaboration Layer (Multi-User, Live-Editing).
- Implement Phase 6: Plugin / API Integration (Extensibility, external models).
- Implement Phase 7: Deployment & Scaling (Load Balancer, Auth, Monitoring).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed a comprehensive set of tasks that greatly advanced the Xionimus AI platform. This included fully implementing a robust **Cloud Sandbox** capable of executing code in 12 different programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Bash, C++, C#, C, Perl, Java, Go, PHP, Ruby, TypeScript), addressing specific memory and configuration challenges for languages like Java, Go, and TypeScript. Additionally, **Code Templates** and **Stdin support** were integrated into the sandbox. The backend for **API Key Management** was fully developed, including encryption, database models, and FastAPI endpoints for managing user-specific API keys. Throughout these implementations, several bugs were identified and fixed, including issues with developer mode overriding, session listing, database dependency injection, user ID access, and frontend React Hooks warnings. Frontend and backend comprehensive tests were performed and passed. The current task involves implementing the **Frontend UI for API Key Management**, specifically integrating the newly created  into the main application's navigation. The AI engineer is currently analyzing the existing layout to determine the optimal placement for a settings navigation link/button.
