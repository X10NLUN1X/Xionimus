The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the Xionimus AI project following a significant product pivot. Initially, the engineer completed a comprehensive hardening and built a local Windows autonomous agent (Phase 1). However, the user then mandated a shift to a fully web-based, cloud-native platform, effectively deprecating the local agent concept.

Despite this pivot, the AI engineer first established the new cloud foundation by migrating the database from SQLite to PostgreSQL, integrating Redis, and configuring AI provider keys. Subsequently, Phase 2 involved implementing advanced LLM functionalities, including Claude model smart routing, default model settings, Ultra Thinking, and Junior/Senior Developer modes with configurable research providers. Following this, the now-deprecated local agent components were completely removed from both backend and frontend, labeled as Phase 4 in the work trajectory. The final action involved removing hardcoded API keys from the environment, preparing for UI-based key input.

<product_requirements>
The user's initial requirements for Xionimus AI included comprehensive project hardening (dependency management, security, testing, database optimization, API versioning, resilience, frontend optimization, accessibility, monitoring). Following this, an autonomous system like GitHub Copilot was requested, leading to a local Windows agent implementation with real-time file monitoring, WebSocket communication, Claude AI, and a frontend dashboard.

A major product pivot then redirected Xionimus towards a **fully web-based, cloud-native platform** resembling emergent.sh. The new roadmap focuses on:
1.  Cloud Backend (REST + WebSocket API, Cloud DB, Auth).
2.  Web Client (Dashboard with Chat, Code, Logs).
3.  Session Engine (AI context, history, persistence).
4.  Cloud Sandbox (Secure online code execution).
5.  Collaboration Layer (Multi-User, Live-Editing).
6.  Plugin / API Integration (Extensibility, external models).
7.  Deployment & Scaling.

The work so far has established the PostgreSQL and Redis cloud backend, implemented LLM routing and developer modes (Junior/Senior Developer), and successfully removed the deprecated local agent components. API keys have been removed from  files, anticipating UI-based input.

<code_architecture>
The project maintains a full-stack  monorepo with a React frontend and FastAPI backend. The database has been migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL, with Redis added for session management.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the removal of all local autonomous agent components from both the backend and frontend of the Xionimus AI application (documented as ). This action aligns with the product pivot towards a fully web-based, cloud-native platform. Following comprehensive testing of the backend and frontend functionalities, the AI engineer proceeded to remove all explicit API keys for Claude, ChatGPT, and Perplexity from the  file. This was done to enable future user-interface-based API key input and was verified by checking the  endpoint, which now correctly reports these providers as . This entire process was documented in . The user's last explicit request was Woe gehts weiter ?, indicating readiness for the next steps in the roadmap.
