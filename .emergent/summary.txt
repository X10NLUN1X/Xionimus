<analysis>
The previous AI engineer has systematically addressed numerous user requests, evolving the application from a basic chat interface with initial streaming issues to a more complex multi-agent system. The trajectory shows a clear pattern of iterative development, debugging, and feature enhancements. Key architectural changes include the removal of an Auto Code Review system and Expansion Agent, the implementation of dynamic AI API key handling, and a significant shift towards a Hybrid Multi-Agent Orchestrator. The engineer has diligently refined frontend display logic for activity panels and backend logic for research, coding prompts, and message processing, while also tackling database integrity and API key configuration errors. The current state reflects ongoing efforts to ensure robust functionality and adherence to the user's vision for an automated, intelligent coding assistant.

The user initially requested fixing a non-functional split-screen stream displaying Arbeite daran. This evolved into a series of detailed enhancements:
1.  **Remove Auto Code Review:** Eliminate unwanted auto code review functionality.
2.  **API Key Management:** Ensure AI API keys are configured via UI settings (not hardcoded) and used dynamically for streaming responses.
3.  **Split-Screen Functionality:** Display the split-screen activity panel correctly, even on the welcome screen.
4.  **Remove Automatic Expansion:** Remove Automatische Verbesserung durch Expansion-Agent and other automated agent messages.
5.  **Activity Panel Visibility:** Ensure the activity panel displays activities, even if empty initially.
6.  **Research Options:** Reinstate and refine the Klein/Mittel/Gro√ü research scope selection, making it more readily available for coding prompts.
7.  **Automated Coding After Research:** After research, automatically proceed to coding without clarification questions.
8.  **Real-time Activity Display:** Show live research/coding activities in the split-screen panel, including source counts and thought streaming.
9.  **Message Deduplication:** Resolve duplicate chat messages in the UI.
10. **Automated Research and Coding Workflow:** For full prompts, automatically prompt for research scope (including an Auto option) and then proceed to automated coding.
11. **Code Expansion/Refinement:** Enable the AI to continue coding and expanding on existing code when prompted, including generating post-code suggestions.
12. **Hybrid Multi-Agent System:** Implement a hybrid multi-agent architecture (inspired by emergent.sh) while retaining existing advantages like transparent control and user-provided API keys.
13. **Specialized AI Model Assignment:** Assign specific, optimized AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity) to individual agents (e.g., Opus 4.1 for Architecture/Debugging, Sonnet 4-5 for Engineering).
14. **Streaming Multi-Agent Output & Activity Panel Display:** Ensure multi-agent output streams and agent activities are displayed in the activity panel.
15. **GitHub Integration:** Fix GitHub connection issues.
16. **Session Persistence & Fork Option:** Ensure sessions are saved correctly and investigate a fork option (implying session management/duplication).

-   : This is the central backend API endpoint for chat interactions. It now contains the logic for detecting coding requests, offering research options, initiating the multi-agent orchestrator, handling messaging, and generating post-code suggestions. It has been modified extensively to remove old auto-review logic, manage research flow, and integrate the new multi-agent system.
-   : **NEW FILE.** This file implements the core logic for the hybrid multi-agent system, defining agent roles, their prompts, and assigning specific AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity) to each agent based on their specialized tasks (e.g., ARCHITECT, ENGINEER, DEBUGGER). It manages the sequential execution and consolidation of agent outputs.
-   : This file contains logic related to identifying coding prompts, generating research questions, and determining if research should be offered. It has been modified to relax conditions for offering research and to include an Auto research option.
-   : This is the main UI component for the chat interface. It has been heavily modified to:
    -   Display the  in the split-screen, even on the welcome screen.
    -   Collect and display  from *all* messages.
    -   Render multi-agent activity updates (though streaming is not fully implemented).
    -   Handle various UI states related to streaming and agent activities.
-   : This component renders the activities in the split-screen panel. It was modified to always be visible (even without activities) and to display enhanced information like thinking steps and source details.
-   : Manages global application state, including messages and sessions. It was updated to include message deduplication logic to prevent duplicates in the UI.
-   : Updated to remove imports and router entries related to the deprecated code review functionality.
-   : Verified for GitHub OAuth credentials, which were found missing.

<pending_tasks>
-   **GitHub OAuth Configuration:** The GitHub integration is not functional due to missing  and  environment variables. The user needs to provide these.
-   **Session Persistence/Database Fix:** The SQLite database () is empty, and database initialization is failing, leading to  errors. This needs to be resolved to ensure sessions are saved.
-   **Multi-Agent Streaming & Activity Panel Display:** Although the multi-agent system is implemented, its output is not streamed, and agents' real-time activities are not fully displayed in the activity panel. The multi-agent mode is currently disabled by default.
-   **Fork Option:** The user requested a fork option, which has not been addressed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was investigating two critical issues reported by the user:
1.  **Sessions werden nicht gespeichert (Sessions are not saved):** The user reported that chat sessions were not being persisted. Upon inspection, the  file in  was found to be 0 bytes, indicating that the database tables were not being created or initialized correctly. A  error was observed during an attempt to inspect the database schema, suggesting a potential environment issue with the  command or a problem in the database initialization script.
2.  **Es gibt keine Fork option (There is no Fork option):** This refers to a feature for duplicating or branching a chat session, which has not yet been addressed or implemented.

The AI engineer's last action in the trajectory was to investigate the database initialization ( and ) within the backend to understand why sessions were not being saved.
