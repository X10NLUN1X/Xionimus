This trajectory details the transition of the Xionimus AI application from an initial MVP state to a refined, but heavily debugged, version. Initially, the AI engineer built a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application with multi-agent LLM integration (Perplexity/Claude), GitHub/file upload, session management, and a dystopian cyberpunk theme. However, the subsequent interaction with the user predominantly involved debugging critical issues.

The core of the work revolved around systematically resolving Docker build failures (e.g.,  conflicts, Node.js versions,  package issues, Docker Compose misconfigurations), UI/UX bugs (scrolling, design brightness, text visibility), and intricate backend API integration problems. Key decisions included shifting from  to direct Anthropic/OpenAI API calls for independence, updating LLM models to , and refactoring frontend API key input. The current challenge is the user's persistent report of API key saving failure, despite the AI fixing the  in the frontend configuration.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a web-based AI assistant, Xionimus AI, mimicking Emergent with chat, code, and project management.
1.  **Core Functionality**: Chat, code, and project management with multi-agent support.
2.  **API Integrations**: Originally Perplexity and Claude using user-provided keys, later changed to be fully independent of Emergent, requiring direct Anthropic/Perplexity API keys. Claude was upgraded to Opus 4.
3.  **UI/UX**: Started as dark/futuristic, then dystopian cyberpunk (Matrix-style, glitch effects, green-red-violet palette). Later redesigned to a modern dark purple/blue gradient theme with clean, simple glass morphism effects. Scrolling functionality was a specific bug fixed.
4.  **Agent System**: Intelligent, task-based routing with specialized agents (Code, Research, Writing, Data, QA, GitHub, File, Session).
5.  **LLM Allocation**: Initially Perplexity for research/chat and Claude for coding/writing. Later refined, with Claude as the primary functional bot after Perplexity's API key incompatibility.
6.  **Branding**: Xionimus AI with custom fonts.
7.  **New Features**: GitHub integration, file upload, session fork for backup/restore, voice input functionality, and API key settings button.
8.  **Installation & Documentation**: Simplified installation scripts and comprehensive guides.
9.  **Local Persistence**: All data (projects, messages, files, sessions, settings) stored locally (MongoDB, file system) with infinite context through smart context loading.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude API, Perplexity API (via OpenAI client compatibility).
-   **UI Framework**: Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Agentic AI**: Multi-agent system with intelligent task routing.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



-   : The main FastAPI application. Extensively modified to handle LLM agent integration, API key management (transitioned from  to direct Anthropic/OpenAI clients), chat logic, model selection, prompt validation, and FastAPI router registration. Updated to use  and increased max tokens. Root endpoint  and API router registration were added.
-   : This directory houses specialized AI agents. Their  orchestrates selection and directs requests to the appropriate LLM client (Claude or Perplexity).
-   : Modified to manage API keys. Initially used , but later reverted to  and  for independence.

-   **Embeddings for Semantic Search**: Implement embeddings for more intelligent context retrieval from the entire history.
-   **Perplexity API Key Configuration**: User needs to provide their own valid  format API key for Perplexity to function, as the Emergent Universal Key is incompatible.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively debugging a persistent issue where the user reported that API keys could not be saved via the frontend. The AI engineer had identified and applied a critical fix: the  in the  file was incorrectly set to an external Emergent URL () instead of the local backend URL (). This prevented the frontend from communicating with the local backend to save API keys.

After correcting this environment variable and restarting the frontend service, internal tests by the AI engineer showed that the API key saving mechanism via direct API calls worked successfully, and the frontend UI appeared fully functional in a screenshot. However, the user's latest message (Geht immer noch nicht:) indicates the problem persists on their end, although the provided logs do not clearly show a failed API request to the *corrected* local backend URL for API key saving. The current state is that the frontend is configured to communicate with the local backend, and the backend's API key saving endpoint is functional, but the user is still experiencing an issue.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Investigate why the API key saving still fails for the user after the  fix.
